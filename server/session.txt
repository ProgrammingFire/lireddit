Session Based Authentication
----------------------------
user submits the form 
on frontend (browser)

browser call the api
then api send the 
credentials to the server

server takes the user
credentials and check
if user exists or not

if user exists then

server stores user id

{ userId: 1 }

in session in memory database
like redis because of speed

redis storage: 
userId -> cw83dwiawudwai7dwahd -> Encrypted Version Of User ID

server decrypt redis key/value:

{ session: { userId: 1 } }

server stores decrypt 
redis key/value to session

then send session id
as cookie to browser

browser send request
to api with that cookie
